Rename my entire project from Prompthancer to Prompthancer.
Do the following steps:

Replace all occurrences of Prompthancer, prompthancer, and variations inside my project with Prompthancer.

Update project metadata:

HTML titles

meta descriptions

README.md

component names

text content

config files

Rename any files or folders that contain “prompthancer” in the filename to use “prompthancer”.

Update any import paths referring to renamed files.

Ensure the landing page branding, headings, and UI elements reflect the new name Prompthancer.

After changes, list all modified files.

Finally, update my git remote to the new repository name by running:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Subaskathayat/prompthancer.git


Don’t change functional logic — only rename branding.

Make all changes automatically.
